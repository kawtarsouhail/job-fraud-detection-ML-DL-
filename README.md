# 🚨 Job Fraud Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **automatic detection of fraudulent job postings**
using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques**.
The objective is to help identify scam job offers by analyzing textual job
descriptions with Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect fraudulent job offers based on textual content
- Compare classical Machine Learning models with Deep Learning approaches
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics

---

## 🧠 Methods & Models
The project explores multiple approaches:

### 🔹 Machine Learning
- TF-IDF for text vectorization
- Logistic Regression for classification

### 🔹 Deep Learning
